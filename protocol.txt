CASIO Ex-Word protocol documentation
====================================

The protocol used by Casio EX-Word electronic dictionaries is a slightly
modified version obex. This custom version prefixes each request with a
sequence number. The response packet is then preceded by a one byte packet
containing the sequence number of the request.

example of a request/response exchange
request:   <seq> <opcode> <packet length> <headers...>
response:  <seq>
           <response code> <response length> <headers...>

List of commands:

Connect
  This command must be the first one you send and is used to make a
  connection to the obex server on the dictionary.

  The request/response for the connect string is defined the same as
  in standard obex except that in the request the version byte is used
  to specifiy operating mode, there are also an additional three
  bytes with the values 0x40, 0x00 and a third byte specifiying the
  region.

  Valid regions:
     Japanese = 0x20
     Korean   = 0x40
     Chinese  = 0x60
     German   = 0x80
     Spanish  = 0xa0
     French   = 0xc0
     Russian  = 0xe0

  Modes:
     TextLoader = <region>
     Library    = <region> - 0xf
     CDLoader   = 0xf0

Disconnect
  This command sends a disconnect to the dictionary and shuts down the usb
  device. It uses the standard obex disconnect opcode with no additional
  headers.

Setpath
  Changes the current path on the dictionary.

  Each pathname needs to begin with either /_INTERNAL_00 or /_SD_00 which
  specify which storage device we are accessing either internal memory or
  the currently inserted SD card.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x85 (setpath) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode pathname.
  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.

Capacity
  Retrieves capacity of currently selected storage device.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x83 (get) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_Cap".
  Response:
    The response returns a length header and end of body header.
    The length header contains the length of data sent in the end of body
    header and should contain the value 8. The end of body header contains
    two 4 byte numbers in network byte order with the first representing the
    total capacity and the second one represents amount of space used.

Model
  Get model information.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x83 (get) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_Model".
  Response:
    The response returns a length header and end of body header.
    The length header contains the length of data sent in the end of body
    header. The end of body header contains two null terminated strings
    containing the model information. So far the first one seems to always
    be the same for all models tested.

List
  Return directory information for the currently selected path.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x83 (get) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_List".
  Response:
    The response returns a length header and end of body header.
    The length header contains the length of data sent in the end of body
    header. The end of body header contains the directory information as
    an array of the following structure.

    struct directory_entry {
        uint16_t size;  //size of structure
        uint8_t  flags; //file = 0, directory = 1, unicode/longname = 2
        uint8_t  name[]; //name of file/directory
    }

Remove
  Removes a file from currently selected path.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x82 (put) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_Remove". Following the name header are a length and
    end of body header. The length gives the length of data in the end of
    body header and the end of body header contains a null terminated string
    of the filename to remove.
  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.

  On DataPlus 5+ devices the name of the file is a utf16 string when in
  Text mode.

SdFormat
  Formats currently inserted SD Card

  Request:
    Uses the 0x82 (put) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_SdFormat". Following the name header are a length and
    end of body header. The length gives the length of data in the end of
    body header and the end of body header contains only a null character.

  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.

Send file
  Sends a file to the dictionary.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x82 (put) opcode followed by a name, length, and body/end of body
    headers. The name header is a Unicode string containing the name of the
    file being sent, the length header should contain the total size of the
    file and the body/end of body headers contain the actual file data.

    If the file is greater then max packet size it will be split across multiple
    put requests only the first one will include the name and length headers.
  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.


Get file
  Sends a file to the dictionary.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x83 (get) opcode followed by a name header. The name header is
    a Unicode string containing the name of the file being retrieved.
  Response:
    The response returns a length header and body/end of body headers.
    The length header contains the length of data sent in the body/end of
    body headers. The body/end of body headers contain the file data
    retrieved.

    If the file is large enough(more then about 4k), it will be split across
    multiple response packets. In this case only the first response contains
    the length header.


AuthChallenge
  Sends an authentication request to the dictionary.

  This command must be issued in Library mode before many commands suchs as
  delete, upload, capacity, etc will work. Somewhat interestingly the List
  command does not require authentication and will if issued cause the other
  commands requring authentication to work as if you had issued a successful
  AuthChallenge command.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x82 (put) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_AuthChallenge". Following the name header are a length
    and end of body header. The length should always be 20 and the end of
    body header should contain the the 20 byte authentication key.
  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.

AuthInfo
  Resets dictionary authentication info stored in authinfo.inf.

  When run this command will also delete all dictionaries currently
  installed on device.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x83 (get) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_AuthInfo". Following the name header is a 40 byte
    non-standard header (0x70) contaning data used to generate a new
    authkey.
  Response:
    The response returns a length header that and end of body header.
    The length header will always be 20 and the end of body header will
    contain the new 20 byte authkey.

UserId
  Sets userid of dictionary.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x82 (put) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_UserId". Following the name header are a length header
    and end of body header. The length should always be 17 and the end of body
    header contains the new username, this should be zero padded to a length
    of 17.
  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.

Unlock
  Unlock device for adding/removing add-ons.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x82 (put) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_Unlock". Following the name header are a length and
    end of body header. The length should always be 1 and the end of body
    always contains a single null byte.
  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.

Lock
  Lock device after removing/adding an add-on.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x82 (put) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_Lock". Following the name header are a length and
    end of body header. The length should always be 1 and the end of body
    always contains a single null byte.
  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.

CName
  Specifies name of dictionary.

  This comand is used to set the name of the add-on dictionary you wish to
  access. It shold be sent immediately after then Unlock comamnd.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x82 (put) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_CName". Following the name header are a length and
    end of body header. The length header contains the length of the
    end of body header and the end of body contains two null terminated
    sjis encoded strings. The first should be the add-on's five character
    ID. The second is the name of the add-on dictionary.
  Response:
    Contains no additional headers.

CryptKey
  Generates a new CryptKey.

  The key returned is not used to directly encrypt the dictionary. Instead it
  is used to generate a secondary key that does the actual encryption.

  Request:
    Uses the 0x83 (get) opcode followed by a name header containing the
    Unicode string "_CryptKey". Following the name header is a non-standard
    header (0x71) containing a 28 byte block used to generate the encryption
    key.

    The algorithim used to generate the 16 byte key looks like the following:
         b[0] b[1] b[2]  b[3]  b[4]  b[5]  b[6]  b[7]  b[8]  b[9]  b[10] b[11]
      +    0    0  b[16] b[17] b[18] b[19] b[20] b[21] b[22] b[23]    0     0

    The last 4 bytes are b[24] - b[27], however only the first 12 are returned
    in the response header.
  Response:
    The response returns a length header that and end of body header.
    The length header will always be 12 and the end of body header will
    contain tthe first 12 bytes of the generated key.
